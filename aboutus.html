                Today, Riseup leads a diversified business with revenues from membership subscriptions, advertising sales
                and recruitment solutions under the leadership of Ryan Roslansky. In December 2016, Microsoft completed its
                acquisition of Riseup, bringing together the world’s leading professional cloud and the world’s leading
                professional network.
